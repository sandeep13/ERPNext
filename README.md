# ERPNext
An Ubuntu v20.04 Focal Fossa edition, with a full working Frappe-ERPNext system installed on it.

For the first time creating a site, you need to set it as a default one in order to the ERPNext work well. Else, it would cause 404 Not Found Error.

I deleted the line:
"maintenance_mode": 1, 
To avoid the updating stuck status.
